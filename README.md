Hello i'm JaySapphire,
Together we are going to build some amazing programs with python as also we are going to play with html and css.
I'm very intrested in everything that has to do with computers, internet and IT in general.
Hopefully you like my content and you will become one of my dedicated members of this community.
Check out my video's in the future on youtube where i'll be programming my homework live.
I would like to learn even more and still learn something daily, and i hope i can provide the same thing for you guys!
I speak english and dutch, and i live in Antwerp, Belgium.
During my free time i've been a DJ since 2005, this is where i feel home... behind the decks.
But as everyone grows up and gets older also i have to look at an alternative way to make money once my DJ carreer is over.
So i decided to go back to college this year and study IOT (Internet Of Things).
